# About the project
This is a finite state machine with 26 states. It introduces both server and client code and the project structure is inherited from Flask projects.
<br/><br/>

## State Machine
 The state machine implemented in this project has 26 states, one per each alphebatic letter (A-Z). State **A** is the initial state and state **Z** is the terminator. These 3 possible transitions from each state, except for state **Z** which only has one transition to **A**.
<br/>
 The full scenario can be found here: [State Machine Structure](State&#32;Machine&#32;Structure.pdf)
<br/><br/>


## Design
It is currecntly deployed with a **TCP** server. The next release will have **RESTful API** server.
